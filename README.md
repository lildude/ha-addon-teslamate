# Home Assistant Add-on: TeslaMate

A self-hosted data logger for your Tesla ðŸš˜

## About

[TeslaMate][teslamate] is a powerful, self-hosted data logger for your Tesla.

- Written in **[Elixir][elixir]**
- Data is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database
- Visualization and data analysis with **Grafana**
- Vehicle data is published to a local **MQTT** Broker

This add-on allows you to run [TeslaMate][teslamate] on your Home Assistant server based on the the official TeslaMate [docker image][docker].

This add-on is a fork of the unmaintained add-on at <https://github.com/matt-FFFFFF/hassio-addon-teslamate>.
Thanks to @matt-FFFFFF for maintaining this add-on in the past.

## Requirements

**TeslaMate v2 needs a PostgreSQL 16.7 or 17.3 or later database.**
I recommend using the [PostgreSQL 17 add-on][alexbelgium-postgres] from @alexbelgium's repository, or [TimescaleDB][timescaledb] (for advanced users), if you aren't already using PostgreSQL.

To get the full experience, it is recommended that you also install the community [Grafana add-on][grafana-addon] and [MQTT integration][mqtt].

## Installation

1. Add my [add-ons repository][addons-repo] to Home Assistant or click the button below to open my add-on repository on your Home Assistant instance.

   [![Open add-on repo on your Home Assistant instance][repo-btn]][addon]

1. Install this add-on.
1. Install the PostgreSQL add-on and configure and start it, if you wish to use this add-on. The database name isn't important here as the TeslaMate add-on will create the database you name in the settings if it doesn't exist.
1. Configure Grafana as detailed in this add-on's documentation.
1. Enter your PostgreSQL configuration information.
1. Enter your Grafana configuration information.
1. Enter your MQTT configuration information.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click the `OPEN WEB UI` button to open TeslaMate.

## Upgrading this add-on from v1 to v2

TeslaMate v2 introduced a hard requirement on the version of PostgreSQL database.
**You will need to use PostgreSQL 16.7 or 17.3 or later.**
If you are currently using an earlier version of PostgreSQL, you will need to backup your TeslaMate data, upgrade the database, and then restore the data.
You can find details on how to do this in the "_Migrate TeslaMate to a Different Postres Server_" section of this add-on's documentation tab or in the [DOCS.md][docs-md] file in the add-on repository.

## Migrating to this version of the add-on

Migrating to this version of the add-on should not result in any loss of data, but you can never be too careful, so I recommend you take a full backup of your Home Assistant instance and also a direct backup of the TeslaMate database as detailed in the [TeslaMate documentation][teslamate-backup] before proceeding.

To migrate:

1. Install this version of the TeslaMate add-on as per the details above. Keep your current version installed for now.
1. Open the old add-on configuration options.
1. Click the three dots at the top and select "Edit in YAML".
1. Highlight and copy all the options.
1. Open this add-on's configuration options.
1. Click the three dots at the top and select "Edit in YAML".
1. Replace all content with the configuration copied above.
1. Stop the old add-on.
1. Start the new add-on.
1. Verify everything is working as before and uninstall the old add-on.

Everything should pick up where it was before.
